      <p><strong>Youth for Christ</strong> was formed on <strong>5 February 2021</strong> through a vision given by God to Abinjose JM. It started with online sessions like fasting prayers, Bible quizzes, and games. Over time, it grew spiritually with the guidance of Christ and the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>In 2023, we formed a leadership team known as the <strong>Heads</strong> — 13 young leaders committed to the vision. Youth for Christ hosted its first major offline camp <strong>"Megalono 2024"</strong> with the theme <em>“Expanding the Territory”</em>, which was a great success.</p>
      <p>We also conducted a <strong>Gospel Social Preach</strong> on Independence Day (15 August 2024) and launched a Bible quiz named <strong>Logos</strong>. Now, we look forward to <strong>Megalono 3.0</strong>, the next edition of Logos, and more gospel-centered events.</p>
      <p><strong>Our mission:</strong> To uplift youth, spread the gospel, and create opportunities for the next generation to <strong>Grow Up in Christ</strong>.</p>

        It provides a platform for youth with musical talents to express their faith and worship through instruments and song.
